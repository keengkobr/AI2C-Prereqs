# Introduction to Minikube

This tutorial shows you how to run a sample app on Kubernetes using minikube. The tutorial provides a container image that uses NGINX to echo back all the requests.

## Objectives

- Deploy a sample application to minikube.
- Run the app.
- View application logs.

## Before you begin

You will need to install minikube. Please follow the guide [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+download) to get your minikube up and running.

> **Note:**
> Only execute the instructions in Step 1, Installation. The rest is covered on this page.

You also need to install kubectl. See Install_Requirements for installation instructions.

## Create a minikube cluster

```bash
minikube start
```

## Open the Dashboard

Open the Kubernetes dashboard via browser launch.

Open a new terminal, and run:

```bash
# Start a new terminal, and leave this running.
minikube dashboard
```

Now, switch back to the terminal where you ran `minikube start`.

> **Note:**
> The dashboard command enables the dashboard add-on and opens the proxy in the default web browser. You can create Kubernetes resources on the dashboard such as Deployment and Service.
>
> To find out how to avoid directly invoking the browser from the terminal and get a URL for the web dashboard, see the "URL copy and paste" tab.
>
> By default, the dashboard is only accessible from within the internal Kubernetes virtual network. The dashboard command creates a temporary proxy to make the dashboard accessible from outside the Kubernetes virtual network.
>
> To stop the proxy, run Ctrl+C to exit the process. After the command exits, the dashboard remains running in the Kubernetes cluster. You can run the dashboard command again to create another proxy to access the dashboard.

## Create a Deployment

A Kubernetes Pod is a group of one or more Containers, tied together for the purposes of administration and networking. The Pod in this tutorial has only one Container. A Kubernetes Deployment checks on the health of your Pod and restarts the Pod's Container if it terminates. Deployments are the recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of Pods.

Use the `kubectl create` command to create a Deployment that manages a Pod. The Pod runs a Container based on the provided Docker image.

```bash
# Run a test container image that includes a webserver
kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080
```

View the Deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

The output is similar to:

```
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello-node   1/1     1            1           1m
```

(It may take some time for the pod to become available. If you see "0/1", try again in a few seconds.)

View the Pod:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The output is similar to:

```
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-node-5f76cf6ccf-br9b5   1/1       Running   0          1m
```

View cluster events:

```bash
kubectl get events
```

View the kubectl configuration:

```bash
kubectl config view
```

View application logs for a container in a pod (replace pod name with the one you got from `kubectl get pods`).

> **Note:**
> Replace `hello-node-5f76cf6ccf-br9b5` in the kubectl logs command with the name of the pod from the `kubectl get pods` command output.

```bash
kubectl logs hello-node-5f76cf6ccf-br9b5
```

The output is similar to:

```
I0911 09:19:26.677397       1 log.go:195] Started HTTP server on port 8080
I0911 09:19:26.677586       1 log.go:195] Started UDP server on port  8081
```

> **Note:**
> For more information about kubectl commands, see the kubectl overview.

## Create a Service

By default, the Pod is only accessible by its internal IP address within the Kubernetes cluster. To make the `hello-node` Container accessible from outside the Kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the Pod as a Kubernetes Service.

> **Warning:**
> The agnhost container has a `/shell` endpoint, which is useful for debugging, but dangerous to expose to the public internet. Do not run this on an internet-facing cluster, or a production cluster.

Expose the Pod to the public internet using the `kubectl expose` command:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

The `--type=LoadBalancer` flag indicates that you want to expose your Service outside of the cluster.

The application code inside the test image only listens on TCP port 8080. If you used `kubectl expose` to expose a different port, clients could not connect to that other port.

View the Service you created:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

The output is similar to:

```
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
hello-node   LoadBalancer   10.108.144.78   <pending>     8080:30369/TCP   21s
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          23m
```

On cloud providers that support load balancers, an external IP address would be provisioned to access the Service. On minikube, the LoadBalancer type makes the Service accessible through the `minikube service` command.

Run the following command:

```bash
minikube service hello-node
```

This opens up a browser window that serves your app and shows the app's response.

## Enable addons

The minikube tool includes a set of built-in addons that can be enabled, disabled and opened in the local Kubernetes environment.

List the currently supported addons:

```bash
minikube addons list
```

The output is similar to:

```
addon-manager: enabled
dashboard: enabled
default-storageclass: enabled
efk: disabled
freshpod: disabled
gvisor: disabled
helm-tiller: disabled
ingress: disabled
ingress-dns: disabled
logviewer: disabled
metrics-server: disabled
nvidia-driver-installer: disabled
nvidia-gpu-device-plugin: disabled
registry: disabled
registry-creds: disabled
storage-provisioner: enabled
storage-provisioner-gluster: disabled
```

Enable an addon, for example, `metrics-server`:

```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

The output is similar to:

```
The 'metrics-server' addon is enabled
```

View the Pod and Service you created by installing that addon:

```bash
kubectl get pod,svc -n kube-system
```

The output is similar to:

```

service/metrics-server         ClusterIP   10.96.241.45    <none>        80/TCP              26s
service/kube-dns               ClusterIP   10.96.0.10      <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP       34m

service/monitoring-influxdb    ClusterIP   10.111.169.94   <none>        8083/TCP,8086/TCP   26s
```

Check the output from metrics-server:

```bash
kubectl top pods
```

The output is similar to:

```
NAME                         CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
hello-node-ccf4b9788-4jn97   1m           6Mi
```

If you see the following message, wait, and try again:

```
error: Metrics API not available
```

Disable metrics-server:

```bash
minikube addons disable metrics-server
```

The output is similar to:

```
metrics-server was successfully disabled
```

## Clean up

Now you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:

```bash
kubectl delete service hello-node
kubectl delete deployment hello-node
```

Stop the Minikube cluster:

```bash
minikube stop
```

Optionally, delete the Minikube VM:

```bash
# Optional
minikube delete
```

However, you will use minikube again to learn more about Kubernetes, so you don't need to delete it.
